        <br /><br />
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">These terms and conditions apply to the ShigramPay Merchant app (hereby referred to as “Application”) for mobile devices that was created by ShigramPay (hereby referred to as “Service Provider”) as a Commercial service.</p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand the terms before using the app. You are prohibited from copying, modifying, translating, publishing, sublicensing, or redistributing the app or any part of it without prior written permission. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.</p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">The Service Provider is dedicated to making the Application as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve the rights to make changes to the Application or charge fees for services at any time. The Service Provider assures you that any changes to the Application are intended to enhance clarity and functionality.</p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly recommends that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which could compromise your device’s security and functionality and may result in the Application not working properly or at all.</p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">The Application may use third-party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions. Below are the links to the Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the Application:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1 mb-4">
          <li>Google Play Services</li>
          <li>Firebase Analytics</li>
          <li>Facebook</li>
          <li>Apple App Store</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of the Application require an active internet connection. This can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot take responsibility for the Application not working at full functionality if you do not have access to Wi-Fi or your data allowance has been exceeded.</p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">If you are using the app outside of a Wi-Fi area, you should be aware that the terms of your agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. Consequently, you may be charged by your mobile provider for data usage while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. You accept responsibility for any such charges. If you are not the bill payer, please ensure you have received permission from the bill payer before using the Application.</p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your use of the application. For instance, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device stays charged. If your device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider cannot accept responsibility.</p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">In line with the Service Provider’s responsibility, the Application is provided "as is", and although efforts are made to ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times, the Service Provider relies on third parties to provide information. They accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying on the functionality of this application.</p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The application is currently available as per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems it may extend to in the future). You’ll need to download updates if you want to continue using the application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the application so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS/Android version that you have installed. However, you agree to always accept updates when offered. The Service Provider may also stop providing the Application and may terminate usage at any time without providing notice.</p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-2">Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">The Service Provider may periodically update these Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised to review this page regularly for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by updating the new Terms and Conditions on this page.</p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-slate-700 mb-6">These terms and conditions are effective as of 2025-06-23.</p>
